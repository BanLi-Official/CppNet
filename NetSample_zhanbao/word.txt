A viable remedy is to exploit the common information coupled and shared by different MR sequences. Multi-contrast MR sequences exhibit similar anatomical struc-tures while emphasizing distinct soft tissues, thereby en-hancing diagnostic information for clinical applications and research, in comparison to single-modality imaging [2]-[4]. Several MC-MRI techniques have yielded outstanding re-construction results [3]-[9]. For instance, Xiang et al. [5] incorporated fully-sampled T1WI as additional channel inputs to facilitate accelerated T2WI reconstruction. Anoth-er novel method [10] strategically concatenated all availa-ble modalities with zero images for missing modalities and calculated the missing inputs through a GAN-guided learn-ing process. In addition, taking advantage of the correla-tions between multi-contrast data, a series of methods [11]-[13] which employed robust feature fusion to create a uni-fied latent representation were proposed.
Recent advances in diffusion model provide new oppor-tunities to explicitly learn complex priors and use them for MRI reconstruction [14]-[15]. As an emerging generation model, the essence of the diffusion model is to learn a dis-tribution from the training set and generate novel samples from it, so its remarkable generative capabilities depend on the learning of the prior distribution. For instance, Peng et al. [16] designed a Hankel-based framework that constructs a Hankel matrix for single k-space data and extracts blocks to derive the potential distribution of the training dataset, reducing the associated time costs and improving the quali-ty of the reconstructed image. A more recent line of works attempted to make good progress in cross-modal medical image generation, which obtained diffusion prior in alter-nated multi-modalities and enforced consistency to ac-quired data through imaging operators [17]-[19].
Inspired by the development of distribution modeling via diffusion model, we propose a Subset-k-space Embedded Diffusion Model (SDEM) method for MC-MRI reconstruc-tion. Initially, we establish a novel prior distribution in an intuitive manner by directly combining the subset-k-space of fully-sampled T1WI and under-sampled T2WI. The strategy
